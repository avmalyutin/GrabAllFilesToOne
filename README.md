GrabAllFilesToOne
=================

This is very simple Java project. You can select folder and programm will read all files from this folder and write the contence of files to one file general.txt in the same directory.

The code is not ideal, so you're welcome to critic it. :-)


UPD 1:
- Made the reading files from subfolders option
- Program now remembers the last choosen directory


What's next?
================
I want to implement some basic features:
- Make a selection for list. Only files, which are selected, will be merged
